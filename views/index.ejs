                    To understand what COVID-19 is we must define what a coronavirus is first; coronaviruses are a large family
                    of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans. In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause
                    respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory
                    Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).

                    COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and
                    disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.

            <h1>How does it spread?</h1>
            <article>
                <p>
                    People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person
                    through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or
                    exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by
                    touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19
                    if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it
                    is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.

            <h1>What are the Symptoms</h1>
            <article>
                <p>
                    The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and
                    pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin
                    gradually. Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people
                    (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who
                    gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with
                    underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop
                    serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.

                    While we are still learning about how COVID-2019 affects people, older persons and persons with pre-existing
                    medical conditions (such as high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, cancer or diabetes) appear to
                    develop serious illness more often than others.

                    <li>
                        Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth
                        and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue
                        immediately.

                    <li>
                        Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention
                        and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.

            <h1>Questions & Answers</h1>
            <article> <br>
                <h3>How likely am I to catch COVID-19?</h3><br>
                <article class="panel">
                    <p>
                        The risk depends on where you are - and more specifically, whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding
                        there.

                        For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is still low. However, there are now
                        places around the world (cities or areas) where the disease is spreading. For people living in, or
                        visiting, these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher. Governments and health authorities are
                        taking vigorous action every time a new case of COVID-19 is identified. Be sure to comply with any local
                        restrictions on travel, movement or large gatherings. Cooperating with disease control efforts will reduce
                        your risk of catching or spreading COVID-19.

                        COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped, as has been shown in China and some other
                        countries. Unfortunately, new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. It’s important to be aware of the situation
                        where you are or intend to go.

                <h3>Is there a vaccine, drug or treatment for COVID-19?</h3>
                <article> <br>
                    <p>
                        Not yet. To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019.
                        However, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. People with serious illness should be
                        hospitalized. Most patients recover thanks to supportive care.

                <h3>Are there any medicines or therapies that can prevent or cure COVID-19</h3><br>
                <article>
                    <p>
                        While some western, traditional or home remedies may provide comfort and alleviate symptoms of COVID-19,
                        there is NO evidence that current medicine can prevent or cure the disease.
                    </p>
                </article>

                <h3>Should I wear a mask to protect myself?</h3><br>
                <article>
                    <p>
                        Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who
                        may have COVID-19. Disposable face mask can only be used once. If you are not ill or looking after someone
                        who is ill then you are wasting a mask. There is a world-wide shortage of masks, so WHO urges people to
                        use masks wisely.

                <h3>Can humans become infected with the COVID-19 from an animal source?</h3><br>
                <article>
                    <p>
                        Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in animals. Occasionally, people get infected
                        with these viruses which may then spread to other people. For example, SARS-CoV was associated with civet
                        cats and MERS-CoV is transmitted by dromedary camels. Possible animal sources of COVID-19 have not yet
                        been confirmed.

                        To protect yourself, such as when visiting live animal markets, avoid direct contact with animals and
                        surfaces in contact with animals. Ensure good food safety practices at all times. Handle raw meat, milk or
                        animal organs with care to avoid contamination of uncooked foods and avoid consuming raw or undercooked
                        animal products.

                <h3>How did the first human SARS-CoV-2 infections occur?</h3><br>
                <article>
                    <p>
                        The first human cases of COVID-19 were identified in Wuhan City, China in December 2019. At this stage, it
                        is not possible to determine precisely how humans in China were initially infected with SARS-CoV-2.

                        However, SARS-CoV, the virus which caused the SARS outbreak in 2003, jumped from an animal reservoir
                        (civet cats, a farmed wild animal) to humans and then spread between humans. In a similar way, it is
                        thought that SARS-CoV-2 jumped the species barrier and initially infected humans, but more likely through
                        an intermediate host, that is another animal species more likely to be handled by humans - this could be a
                        domestic animal, a wild animal, or a domesticated wild animal and, as of yet, has not been identified.

                        Until the source of this virus is identified and controlled, there is a risk of reintroduction of the
                        virus in the human population and the risk of new outbreaks like the ones we are currently experiencing.
